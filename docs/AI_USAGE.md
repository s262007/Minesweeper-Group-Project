## R1-S0: shared contract and interfaces (15 October 2026)

Codex helped draft the contract, parameter definitions, shared Chisel interfaces and contract tests from the team's project plan and agreed settings. It also edited the wording and corrected the starter CI branch filters from master to main.

The local contract suite passed all 12 tests using Scala 2.13.14, Chisel 3.6.1 and ChiselTest 0.6.2. R2/R3 review is pending. The team will review the rules, defaults, LFSR sequence and interface timing before freezing the contract.

## R1-S0: independent setup work (16 October 2026)

Codex drafted R1 module shells, elaboration/smoke tests, the S0 backlog and board-status record, PR template, build-output ignore rules, Z3 tool-check setup, license and upstream notice. The user authorized license selection. MIT applies to original contributions; starter reuse terms are unresolved. IntelliJ guidance follows the existing temurin-25 setup. Team approvals and R2/R3 implementation remain pending. See CONTRACT_VALIDATION.md for checks actually run.
